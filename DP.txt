Dynamic Programming: 
    Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion.
    Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming.
    The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later.
    This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.

(a) Tabulation: Also knows as Top Down Approach
		Using the array for the table to store athe subproblem in the memory, so the previous calculated sum should not be calculated again and again

(b) Memoization: We store the value of the subproblems in some map or table.
